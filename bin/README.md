# Yuriamor

A basic textbased mobile RPG coded in Java

NEEDS
-Leveling needs to be balanced and whether or not there will be a cap needs to be decided

-Stats have to be balanced along with level, the user needs to have some customizability with these as well, or we could just have it be progressional increase

-Weapons should be unique and at multiple levels of rarity, using colored text to show how rare exactly, could be purely cosmetic or we could have them add to stats

-Tools include potions, buffs, and even the professional tools like pickaxes and axes for if they want to do some professional work instead of adventuring

-Professions could include gathering, farming, mining, woodcutting, so on and so forth, depending on what we think we need. Will add some variety to the game and a break from the normal adventure.

-Money or currency will be a must so that adventurers are always collecting something besides just exp and items. It must be obtainable through multiple methods.

-Towns these should be a must throughout the game and will be important for shopping for new items, warp portals maybe, and/or questing if we include that.

-Monsters will be balanced around your level and have a certain range of which monsters can fight you in what regions. Will be a lot of randomness around this.

-Battling will entail a text based combat system where you basically choose to battle, use item, or flee. Could include special weapon skills maybe too.

-Adventuring around Yuriamor will leave the adventurer with choices as to what he does and where he goes and what he finds. Adventures could lead to treasures, monsters, boss fights, anything, completely random.

-Story (however slight) should be a necessity in order to captivate those looking for some kind of escape, else this game will feel very much static like and not interesting to the few who aren’t interested in straight up leveling.

-Random events will be used in basically every part of the game, from special items in the store, to adventuring the wilderness, to gathering from a rock.

-Unique dialog for the most part, don’t want to be repeating the same thing (don’t want it getting stale over continual play time)

=========================================================================

What this will require…
Let’s start with one thing at a time…

As far as necessities go, the basics of the game disregarding graphics should be our primary focus. Our first task should be to create an app that first has you enter a name at startup and saves that name into a variable, for introduction purposes and using your name throughout the game. This will also allow us to test out the code we’ll need in the codename one plugin so that we get a feel for how to use it. This is all we need right now…
 Ask for name, Get name.
Will fill this in once we finish first step, we will also need to document how we accomplished the first step so that we can remember in case we need to go back and change it.
